### About me

I am Ifedayo Adeniyi, a Nigerian Software Engineer. Iâ€™m a big lover of everything back-end and front-end related. I have worked with React, Gatsby and head-less CMS's like Contentful and netlify on the frontend, while using NodeJS and mongoDB/PostgreSQL on the backend. Coming from an engineering background, problem solving is second nature to me, along with non-technical communication, team-driven development, and focus on cost-efficient solutions.

#### Skills
- NodeJS
- React
- Gatsby
- Docker
- Git
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript/TypeScript
