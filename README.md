#### 💬 About

I'm a NodeJS Software Engineer at [HNG](https://hng.tech/), working on super secret stuff, while also working on open source projects I'm passionate about. I'm a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) fan on the frontend, and a bigger [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) fan on the backend, but dabble in [Go](https://golang.org/) sometimes. I love writing about tech, and I'm currently taking a course in technical writing at [Penmen](https://medium.com/penmen). Coming from an engineering background, problem solving and a focus on cost-efficient solutions is second nature to me.
