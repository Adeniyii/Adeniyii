#### 💬 About

I'm a FullStack Software Engineer at [BetaQuick](https://betaquick.com/), working on super exciting stuff, while also working on side projects I'm passionate about. I'm a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) fan on the frontend, and a bigger [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) fan on the backend, but dabble in [Go](https://golang.org/) sometimes. I love writing about tech, and I'm currently taking a course in technical writing at [Penmen](https://medium.com/penmen). Coming from an engineering background, problem solving and a focus on cost-efficient solutions is second nature to me.
